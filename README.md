This Java banking project demonstrates core object-oriented programming principles through a comprehensive banking system built entirely in Java. The application utilizes multiple classes such as BankAccount, Customer, Transaction, and BankingSystem to model real-world banking operations including account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and balance inquiries. The project leverages core Java features like encapsulation to protect sensitive account data, inheritance to create different account types (savings, checking, business), and polymorphism to handle various transaction types uniformly. File handling capabilities are implemented using Java's I/O classes to persist customer data and transaction history in .txt files, while the application also incorporates GIF files for an enhanced user interface, displaying animated icons for different banking operations like money transfers and account updates. The system employs exception handling to manage invalid transactions, array lists to store multiple customer accounts, and demonstrates key Java concepts such as constructors, method overloading, and access modifiers, making it an excellent project for understanding practical applications of core Java programming in a business context.
